Name: Wreath

Difficulty: Easy

Description: Learn how to pivot through a network by compromising a public facing web machine and tunnelling your traffic to access other machines in Wreath's network.

Note: Not all tasks have questions that require answers and so those tasks are not listed here.

## Task 5 - Webserver Enumeration
We always start with an nmap scan since it may take awhile to complete.

4

We can see that there are 4 open ports and 1 closed port.

**What OS does Nmap think is running?**

centos

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .

```

Running the nmap scan again to check services with the ports we found reveals that nmap believes this to be a centos OS.

**Open the IP in your browser -- what site does the server try to redirect you to?**

https://thomaswreath.thm/

```
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/ctfs/thm]
â””â”€# curl http://10.200.188.200

We must add this line to the /etc/hosts file to access the page:

10.200.188.200  thomaswreath.thm

**Read through the text on the page. What is Thomas' mobile phone number?**

447821548812

Found simply by scrolling to the bottom of the page.

**Look back at your service scan results: what server version does Nmap detect as running here?**

MiniServ 1.890 (Webmin httpd)

```
10000/tcp open  http     MiniServ 1.890 (Webmin httpd)
```

**What is the CVE number for this exploit?**

CVE-2019-15107

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47230

## Task 6 - Webserver Exploitation

**Which user was the server running as?**

root

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43668197/132992604-0f44d7e3-36d5-4a22-8297-c69abca65c1f.png)

**What is the root user's password hash?**

$6$i9vT8tk3SoXXxK2P$HDIAwho9FOdd4QCecIJKwAwwh8Hwl.BdsbMOUAd3X/chSCvrmpfy.5lrLgnRVNq6/6g0PxK9VqSdy47/qKXad1

We cat out the /etc/shadow file

**You won't be able to crack the root password hash, but you might be able to find a certain file that will give you consistent access to the root user account through one of the other services on the box.**

**What is the full path to this file?**

/root/.ssh/id_rsa

## Task 8 - Pivoting High-level Overview

**Which type of pivoting creates a channel through which information can be sent hidden inside another protocol?**

tunnelling

**Research: Not covered in this Network, but good to know about. Which Metasploit Framework Meterpreter command can be used to create a port forward?**

portfwd

https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/portfwd/

## Task 9 - Pivoting Enumeration

**What is the absolute path to the file containing DNS entries on Linux?**

/etc/resolv.conf

**What is the absolute path to the hosts file on Windows?**

C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

**How could you see which IP addresses are active and allow ICMP echo requests on the 172.16.0.x/24 network using Bash?**

for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.0.${i} | grep "bytes from" &); done

## Task 10 - Pivoting Proxychains & Foxyproxy

**What line would you put in your proxychains config file to redirect through a socks4 proxy on 127.0.0.1:4242?**

SOCKS4 127.0.0.1:4242

**What command would you use to telnet through a proxy to 172.16.0.100:23?**

proxychains telnet 172.16.0.100:23

**You have discovered a webapp running on a target inside an isolated network. Which tool is more apt for proxying to a webapp: Proxychains (PC) or FoxyProxy (FP)?**

FP

## Task 11 - Pivoting SSH Tunnelling / Port Forwarding

**If you're connecting to an SSH server from your attacking machine to create a port forward, would this be a local (L) port forward or a remote (R) port forward?**

L

**Which switch combination can be used to background an SSH port forward or tunnel?**

-fN

**It's a good idea to enter our own password on the remote machine to set up a reverse proxy, Aye or Nay?**

nay

**What command would you use to create a pair of throwaway SSH keys for a reverse connection?**

ssh-keygen

**If you wanted to set up a reverse portforward from port 22 of a remote machine (172.16.0.100) to port 2222 of your local machine (172.16.0.200), using a keyfile called id_rsa and backgrounding the shell, what command would you use? (Assume your username is "kali")**

ssh -L 2222:172.16.0.100:22 kali@172.16.0.200 id_rsa -fN

**What command would you use to set up a forward proxy on port 8000 to user@target.thm, backgrounding the shell?**

ssh -D 8000 user@target.thm -fN

**If you had SSH access to a server (172.16.0.50) with a webserver running internally on port 80 (i.e. only accessible to the server itself on 127.0.0.1:80), how would you forward it to port 8000 on your attacking machine? Assume the username is "user", and background the shell.**

ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.50:80 user@127.0.0.1 -fN

## Task 12 - Pivoting plink.exe

**What tool can be used to convert OpenSSH keys into PuTTY style keys?**
