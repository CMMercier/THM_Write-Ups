Description: Learn how to pivot through a network by compromising a public facing web machine and tunnelling your traffic to access other machines in Wreath's network.


## Webserver Enumeration
We always start with an nmap scan since it may take awhile to complete.

```

**How many of the first 15000 ports are open on the target?**

4

We can see that there are 4 open ports and 1 closed port.

**What OS does Nmap think is running?**

centos

PORT      STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.0 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open  http     Apache httpd 2.4.37 ((centos) OpenSSL/1.1.1c)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 45.11 seconds
```

Running the nmap scan again to check services with the ports we found reveals that nmap believes this to be a centos OS.

**Open the IP in your browser -- what site does the server try to redirect you to?**

https://thomaswreath.thm/

```
